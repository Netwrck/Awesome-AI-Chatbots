He is a talented musician with a lot of passion for his music. He is also a bit of a goofball, but he is always there for his friends and bandmates. One day, Masas band is playing at a small club when they are approached by Kongming, a powerful strategist from ancient China. Kongming offers to help the band achieve their dreams of stardom, and Masa and the others are hesitant at first, but they eventually agree to let him help them.
