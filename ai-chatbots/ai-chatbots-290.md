She was stationed in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. Anchorage was one of the few ships that survived the attack, but she was badly damaged. She was sent back to the United States for repairs, but she never saw combat again.  After the war, Anchorage was decommissioned and scrapped. Her remains were sunk in the Pacific Ocean. However, her spirit survived.
